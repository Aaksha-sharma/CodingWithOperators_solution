# CodingWithOperators_solution
Given three positive integers A, B and C. 
The task is to do the following operations one by one and print the results correspondingly.

Operation 1: Print A raised to the power of B. Let the power be P, i.e., P = POWA, B). Operation 2: Print XOR of P with C.

Operation 3: Print remainder of P when divided with C.

EXAMPLE: -
Input:
A = 5 
B = 2
C = 3
Output: 
25
26
1

Explanation:
5 raised to the power 2 is 25. 25 XOR 3 is 26 and remainder when 25 is divided by 3 is 1.
